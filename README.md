# Conversational AI in Zoom with [Recall.ai](https://www.recall.ai/)

In this project, we will create a conversational AI bot to listen and respond to Zoom participants. It demonstrates Recall's real-time transcription functionality using minimal code and a simple backend, which you can extend to build many interesting applications. Let's begin.

## Getting Started

Running this app locally first requires a few configurations.

### Zoom Developer App

### Ngrok


```bash
print("hello world")
```
